# CSC391---Image-Formation-and-Geometric-Transformations
AI was used in week one repo to generate code with the new library which I adjusted to properly match the transformation needed to match the transformed image. 
Also I was struggling to understand the graphing functionality of the matplotlib so AI helped me to generate and understand this library a little more to make sure that I was porperly visualizing the data in the correct way.
